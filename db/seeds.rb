# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
  # posts = Post.create(
  #           [
  #             { title: 'Star Wars' ,body: 'test'},
  #             { title: 'Lord of the Rings' , body: 'test'}
  #           ]
  #         )
